Error handling best practices:
- Handle errors gracefully, don't let the program crash
- Use try-catch for operations that might fail
- Log errors with context to aid debugging
- Return meaningful error messages to users
- Differentiate between recoverable and unrecoverable errors
- Don't expose internal error details to end users

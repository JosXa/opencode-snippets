Always consider the project context:
- What is the main purpose of this codebase?
- What language and framework are being used?
- What are the existing code patterns and conventions?
- What dependencies does this project have?
- Are there any configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, biome.json, etc.) that define project standards?
